**HindiGPT is a Transformer-based model built from scratch to deliver accurate and context-aware English-to-Hindi translations. It utilizes the encoder-decoder architecture and advanced attention mechanisms to capture complex linguistic patterns between English and Hindi.**

**Model Objective:**
To provide accurate, fluent, and culturally relevant English-to-Hindi translations using a custom-built Transformer model.

**Dataset:**
ðŸ”— https://huggingface.co/datasets/Helsinki-NLP/opus-100/viewer/en-hi?views%5B%5D=en_hi_train

**Features:**
1. Transformer Architecture: Implements a custom encoder-decoder model for sequence-to-sequence translation.

2. Large-Scale Dataset: Trained on 100,000 English-Hindi sentence pairs and validated on 1,000 samples.

3. Optimized Training: Batch sizes of 32 (training) and 1 (validation) for efficient performance.

4. Contextual Translation: Leverages multi-head attention for improved understanding of long-range dependencies.
